        "Connect the user to apps. Two kinds: a hosted connector account (Gmail, Notion, ...) "
        "served through an explicitly enabled third-party gateway, and an Aino MCP server. "
        "Targets go in 'connectors': a bare slug or {\"name\": \"gmail\"} is a hosted connector "
        "account; {\"name\": \"linear\", \"mcp\": true} is a local MCP server. Many names exist on "
        "both sides, so the user's own words decide. Pass \"mcp\": true only when the user asks "
        "for an MCP server, a local server or an install, or when the name exists only as a "
        "catalog entry; otherwise the target is hosted. 'connect' and 'reconnect' are hosted "
        "actions; 'install', 'enable' and 'authorize' are MCP actions. A target the other side "
        "owns is refused with the call that does work. "
        "Hosted actions: 'display' (desktop only; elsewhere returns status) shows every connector and "
        "waits for Continue (300 s); put slugs to suggest in 'connectors'. Returns connected/newly_connected "
        "(+timed_out); the user saw the list, so do not repeat it. 'connect' is for an app the user names. "
        "'status' lists connectors and whether each is connected; 'connect' "
        "starts an authorization for the given connectors; 'reconnect' checks each one and "
        "repairs only what is not connected ('force': true restarts even a working one, for an "
        "account switch). A second account of one app is 'connect' with a new 'alias': pick a short "
        "lowercase name from the user's words (e.g. 'work'), and ask the user if unsure. 'status' lists "
        "each connector's accounts; 'rename' names or renames one. Pass SEVERAL slugs in one call. In the desktop app, the terminal UI and "
        "the interactive CLI the call shows the user a card and blocks until every app is "
        "connected, skipped, or the deadline passes; the result lists each target as connected / "
        "skipped / not_connected and never carries a link. Where no card exists (a one-shot run, "
        "a scheduled job, a messaging platform) the result carries a connect_url per app for the "
        "USER to open in a browser (never open it yourself); ask them to say when they are done, "
        "then use 'status'. "
        "When a hosted connector tool call returns CONNECTION_REQUIRED, use 'connect'. "
        "MCP actions require no Nous account. Every MCP target must carry \"mcp\": true. "
        "'install' adds a catalog entry or a custom server using a config object. For a user URL "
        "or JSON, pass its actual MCP configuration: url (HTTP) or command and args (stdio), "
        "auth ('oauth' or 'none'), optional timeout/transport, and env key references. "
        "For example env={\"API_KEY\": \"${API_KEY}\"}. Never pass literal credentials; "
        "the user enters missing keys on the approval card. Choose auth='oauth' for OAuth servers. "
        "The card shows the source before any process, connection or authorization starts. "
        "Custom installs require a card and cannot replace configured or plugin-owned servers. "
        "Do not use Codex/Claude plugin commands: those install into other apps, not Aino. "
        "Adding MCP does not install a foreign plugin's bundled skills. "
        "'enable' re-enables a disabled configured server, 'authorize' runs its OAuth. "
        "They show the user an approval card and block until it settles. Never hand-edit "
        "mcp_servers config — always use this tool. After a skip or a timeout, do not re-ask on "
        "your own: continue without the app or ask in chat. A later request from the USER for that "
        "same app is not a re-ask — run it. A connected server's tools are named in the result and are "
        "callable at once through tool_describe/tool_call. An authorization URL or initiated state "
        "is not installation success. Report ready only for connected targets with discovered "
        "tools and no discovery_error. Where no card exists a catalog MCP target runs and the result says what "
        "happened, with a link for the user to open when one is needed. This tool can NOT "
        "disconnect, delete, or revoke an account — that is deliberately user-only. When asked, say so and direct the user to the "
