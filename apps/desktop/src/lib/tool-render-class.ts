//     render their own markup: a question the user has to answer, an image
//     they asked for, the several agents a fan-out is running.
//   - `manage_connections` and `manage_catalog` are consent cards; their controls must stay visible.
//   - `set_theme` shows a picker card while it waits for the user, then a one-line receipt.
//   - `setup_beat` is the onboarding chat's card for one beat, then a one-line receipt.
//
// Everything else is ephemeral activity — reads, searches, commands — which is
// what a run summarizes and what the live ticker cycles through.
